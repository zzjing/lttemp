// 1. For each query, traverse every word in that query
// and match it with every job description (say n jds, possibly n sets), compute n match scores
// 2. Sort n match scores and get top 10 based on rules

// inverted index:
// Map<String, String> every word in jd --> jd that contains that word
// get a query: traverse every word in query and compute match count for every jd
// get top 10 based on rules
